                | Processing of Personal Data of Adset&rsquo;s Customers and Website Users

            p
                | What is the GDPR and How it Affects Adset Customers On May 25, 2018, The European Union enforces a new data privacy
                | law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A primary aim of the GDPR is to harmonize data privacy laws
                | across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the
                | region approach it. Any company that collects or processes personal data of persons in the EU falls under the scope
                | of the GDPR, even if the company has no physical presence in the European Union. This means that most businesses
                | with a global or online presence, including Adset customers are affected.

            p
                | We at Aditec Solutions UAB (Mokslinink&uogon; str. 2A, Vilnius, the Republic of Lithuania) (&ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) believe that
                | protecting our customers&rsquo; and business partners&rsquo; privacy is crucial to our business and values. In the course of our
                | business operations, we receive, collect, maintain, use and share personal data on customers and business partners.
                | We are committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who visit our website (visitors), individuals who register
                | to use our services (customers), and individuals who register to attend our corporate events (attendees)
                | (collectively hereinafter &ldquo;Data Subject(s)&rdquo; or &ldquo;User(s)&rdquo;). The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to demonstrate our
                | robust commitment to the Data Subjects&rsquo; right to privacy and data protection.
            p
                | This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify a Data
                | Subject (the &ldquo;Personal Data&rdquo;) and describes our practices in relation to the use of our website(s) and the related
                | applications and services offered by us (collectively, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;), as well as Data Subjects&rsquo; choices regarding
                | their rights such as use, access and rectification of Personal Data. We act as a controller with respect to the
                | information we process in connection with our business relationships. For example, we are the controller in relation
                | to Data Subjects&rsquo; contact details and other commercial Personal Data. On the other hand, we may also act as a
                | processor of Data Subjects&rsquo; Personal Data when our customer and business partners engage us to process Personal Data
                | on their behalf, for example in connection with the provision of the Services. We may also act as a processor in
                | certain circumstances when our customers use third party service providers in connection with our Services (e.g.
                | Facebook).
            p
                | When we act as the processor, we process the data in accordance with applicable privacy laws and the data processing
                | agreement entered into with the controller, where applicable. In such a case, please refer to the Privacy Policies
                | of controllers for further information on the processing of Personal Data. Unless otherwise expressly stated herein,
                | the terms used in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in the General Data Protection Regulation
                | (EU) 2016/679 (the &ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;).
            p
                | 1. Processing of Personal Data We process Personal Data of Data Subjects to offer the Services, including the
                | processing and execution of demo requests relating to the Services, and to contact and market our Services to the
                | participants of our business events and to contact and send marketing material to the visitors of our websites who
                | submit us their information in a form or otherwise with the intent to receive marketing or other information from
                | Adset.io. In this context, Personal Data may be processed for market and customer analysis, reporting and

                | and maintenance, product suggestions and offers, interaction with external social networks, access to third party
                | services&apos; accounts and platforms, heat mapping and newsletters. Personal Data may be used for direct marketing,
                | including, where applicable, by electronic means unless objected by the Data Subject. Further, Personal Data may be
                | used for invoicing and to send important information to the Data Subject e.g. regarding changes of applicable fees,
                | price list and conditions, or to contact the Data Subject and provide information customised Services according to
                | the interests of the Data Subject. We processes Personal Data on the following basis: &bull; for the performance of the
                | contract between us and the Data Subject (Article 6.1(b) of the GDPR); &bull; for the purposes of our legitimate
                | interests related to the customer and business relationships between us and the Data Subjects (Article 6(f) of the
                | GDPR); &bull; to comply with legal obligations applicable to us (Article 6(c) of the GDPR, such as corporate and
                | accounting). We may ask for Data Subject&rsquo;s consent for the processing of certain type of Personal Data (for example
                | for a campaign). When collecting such consents, we inform the Data Subject of the respective purposes of processing
                | and such processing is conducted only when appropriate consent is received. We may ask for certain Facebook
                | permissions allowing us to perform actions with the Data Subject&rsquo;s Facebook account and to retrieve information,
                | including Personal Data, from it. This allows our Services to connect with the User&apos;s account on the Facebook social
                | network, provided by Facebook Inc. In this context, the following permissions may be asked: About Me, Access Rights
                | (including but not limited to Ad Account Access, Business Manager Access), App Notifications, Contact Email, Manage
                | Advertisements, and Manage Pages. For more information about the Facebook permissions, refer to the Facebook
                | permissions documentation and to the Facebook Data Policy.
            p
                | 2. Personal Data we collect and use Personal Data processed by us is mainly obtained directly from the Data Subject.
                | Provision of such Personal Data is necessary to use and purchase our Services, to accommodate Data Subject&rsquo;s request
                | for information relating to our Services and to organize communication in relation to our business events. We may
                | not provide the Services to a Data Subject that refuses the processing of his/her Personal Data. We process also
                | Personal Data accumulating from the use of our Services (including data collected under our cookie policy), and
                | obtained from third party sources related to the Services. Personal Data may be updated and supplemented by
                | collecting data from private and public registers. We collect the following Personal Data in conjunction with the
                | Data Subject&apos;s (i) use of our Services, (ii) requests for information through our website and (iii) participation to
                | our business events: name, phone number, e-mail address, usage data and cookies or any other information the user
                | can provide via form (in website) . In addition, we may process various other types of Personal Data generated in
                | connection with the Data Subject&rsquo;s use of any third party services and applications as specified in the privacy
                | policy of such third party service or application. We do not collect sensitive information (Personal Data of special
                | categories).
            p
                | 3. Disclosure of Personal Data For the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, Personal Data may be disclosed, when
                | necessary, to authorities, other companies within the same group of companies as us, companies which the group
                | cooperates with and to other third parties, such as third party service providers used in connection with our
                | Services and services related thereto. Personal Data may be transferred outside the European Union and the European
                | Economic Area (&ldquo;EU/EEA&rdquo;), including but not limited to, the United States of America, China, Australia, Singapore
                | and Argentina as well as other locations and jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such transfers outside
                | the EU/EEA are performed subject to appropriate safeguards such as standard data protection clauses adopted or
                | otherwise approved by the EU Commission in accordance with the GDPR (&ldquo;Standard Data Protection Clauses&rdquo;). The
                | applicable Standard Data Protection Clauses are made available for review to the Data Subject upon request.
            p
                | 4. Retention Period We retain Data Subject&rsquo;s Personal Data for three years from Data Subject&rsquo;s latest purchase or
                | contact with us. Personal Data may be, wholly or in part, retained for longer or shorter term if required by
                | applicable law or if there is other justified reason to retain or delete them. In such a case, Data Subject&rsquo;s
                | Personal Data shall be erased with no further delay after there is no longer any need for such a retention. We
                | evaluate the necessity and accuracy of the Personal Data on a regular basis.
            p
                | 5. Data Subjects&rsquo; Rights Data Subject has a right to request from us: &bull; access to and rectification or erasure of
                | Data Subject&rsquo;s Personal Data; &bull; for restriction of processing concerning the Data Subject or to object to
                | processing; and &bull; to receive, under certain preconditions, Data Subject&rsquo;s Personal Data in a structured, commonly
                | used and machine-readable format and to transmit those data to another controller. Data Subject may exercise the
                | aforementioned rights by sending a written request to us. Where the processing is based on consent, Data Subject has
                | a right to withdraw such consent at any time. Please Policy that this will not affect the lawfulness of processing
                | based on consent before its withdrawal. In case the Data Subject considers that its rights under the data protection
                | laws are infringed, the Data Subject may lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority of the Data Subject&rsquo;s
                | residence in the EU (e.g. in Finland the Finnish Data Protection Ombudsman).
            p
                | 6. Security Safeguards Securing the integrity and confidentiality of Personal Data. We have taken adequate technical
                | and organisational measures in order to keep Personal Data safe and to secure it against unauthorized access, loss,
                | misuse or alteration by third parties, such as encryption, access controls, firefalls. Nevertheless, considering the
                | cyber threats in modern day online environment, we cannot 100% guarantee that our security measures will prevent
                | illegally and maliciously operating third parties from obtaining access to Personal Data and the absolute security
                | of that information during its transmission or its storage on our systems.
            p
                | 7. Other We may make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time by giving Policy on the website and/or by other
                | applicable means. It is highly recommended that Data Subjects check this Privacy Policy and the website every now
                | and then, referring to the date of the last modification listed at the top of this page. If a Data Subject objects
                | to any of the changes to this Privacy Policy, the Data Subject should cease using the Services, where applicable,
                | and can request that we remove the Personal Data, unless applicable laws require storage of the Personal Data.
                | Unless stated otherwise, the then-current Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Data we have about Data
                | Subjects.
