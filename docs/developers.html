      <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1><strong>
        Processing of Personal Data of Adset&rsquo;s Customers and Website Users
        Updated: 8 July 2018</strong>
      <h3>GDPR</h3>
      <p>
        What is the GDPR and How it Affects Adset Customers On May 25, 2018, The European Union enforces a new data privacy
        law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A primary aim of the GDPR is to harmonize data privacy laws
        across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the
        region approach it. Any company that collects or processes personal data of persons in the EU falls under the scope
        of the GDPR, even if the company has no physical presence in the European Union. This means that most businesses
        with a global or online presence, including Adset customers are affected.
      </p><a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more</a>
      <p>
        We at Aditec Solutions UAB (Mokslinink&uogon; str. 2A, Vilnius, the Republic of Lithuania) (&ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) believe that
        protecting our customers&rsquo; and business partners&rsquo; privacy is crucial to our business and values. In the course of our
        business operations, we receive, collect, maintain, use and share personal data on customers and business partners.
        We are committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who visit our website (visitors), individuals who register
        to use our services (customers), and individuals who register to attend our corporate events (attendees)
        (collectively hereinafter &ldquo;Data Subject(s)&rdquo; or &ldquo;User(s)&rdquo;). The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to demonstrate our
        robust commitment to the Data Subjects&rsquo; right to privacy and data protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify a Data
        Subject (the &ldquo;Personal Data&rdquo;) and describes our practices in relation to the use of our website(s) and the related
        applications and services offered by us (collectively, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;), as well as Data Subjects&rsquo; choices regarding
        their rights such as use, access and rectification of Personal Data. We act as a controller with respect to the
        information we process in connection with our business relationships. For example, we are the controller in relation
        to Data Subjects&rsquo; contact details and other commercial Personal Data. On the other hand, we may also act as a
        processor of Data Subjects&rsquo; Personal Data when our customer and business partners engage us to process Personal Data
        on their behalf, for example in connection with the provision of the Services. We may also act as a processor in
        certain circumstances when our customers use third party service providers in connection with our Services (e.g.
        Facebook).
      </p>
      <p>
        When we act as the processor, we process the data in accordance with applicable privacy laws and the data processing
        agreement entered into with the controller, where applicable. In such a case, please refer to the Privacy Policies
        of controllers for further information on the processing of Personal Data. Unless otherwise expressly stated herein,
        the terms used in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in the General Data Protection Regulation
        (EU) 2016/679 (the &ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;).
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Processing of Personal Data We process Personal Data of Data Subjects to offer the Services, including the
        processing and execution of demo requests relating to the Services, and to contact and market our Services to the
        participants of our business events and to contact and send marketing material to the visitors of our websites who
        submit us their information in a form or otherwise with the intent to receive marketing or other information from
        Adset.io. In this context, Personal Data may be processed for market and customer analysis, reporting and
        statistical purposes, marketing purposes such as customised marketing, administration notices, database management
        and maintenance, product suggestions and offers, interaction with external social networks, access to third party
        services&apos; accounts and platforms, heat mapping and newsletters. Personal Data may be used for direct marketing,
        including, where applicable, by electronic means unless objected by the Data Subject. Further, Personal Data may be
        used for invoicing and to send important information to the Data Subject e.g. regarding changes of applicable fees,
        price list and conditions, or to contact the Data Subject and provide information customised Services according to
        the interests of the Data Subject. We processes Personal Data on the following basis: &bull; for the performance of the
        contract between us and the Data Subject (Article 6.1(b) of the GDPR); &bull; for the purposes of our legitimate
        interests related to the customer and business relationships between us and the Data Subjects (Article 6(f) of the
        GDPR); &bull; to comply with legal obligations applicable to us (Article 6(c) of the GDPR, such as corporate and
        accounting). We may ask for Data Subject&rsquo;s consent for the processing of certain type of Personal Data (for example
        for a campaign). When collecting such consents, we inform the Data Subject of the respective purposes of processing
        and such processing is conducted only when appropriate consent is received. We may ask for certain Facebook
        permissions allowing us to perform actions with the Data Subject&rsquo;s Facebook account and to retrieve information,
        including Personal Data, from it. This allows our Services to connect with the User&apos;s account on the Facebook social
        network, provided by Facebook Inc. In this context, the following permissions may be asked: About Me, Access Rights
        (including but not limited to Ad Account Access, Business Manager Access), App Notifications, Contact Email, Manage
        Advertisements, and Manage Pages. For more information about the Facebook permissions, refer to the Facebook
        permissions documentation and to the Facebook Data Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Personal Data we collect and use Personal Data processed by us is mainly obtained directly from the Data Subject.
        Provision of such Personal Data is necessary to use and purchase our Services, to accommodate Data Subject&rsquo;s request
        for information relating to our Services and to organize communication in relation to our business events. We may
        not provide the Services to a Data Subject that refuses the processing of his/her Personal Data. We process also
        Personal Data accumulating from the use of our Services (including data collected under our cookie policy), and
        obtained from third party sources related to the Services. Personal Data may be updated and supplemented by
        collecting data from private and public registers. We collect the following Personal Data in conjunction with the
        Data Subject&apos;s (i) use of our Services, (ii) requests for information through our website and (iii) participation to
        our business events: name, phone number, e-mail address, usage data and cookies or any other information the user
        can provide via form (in website) . In addition, we may process various other types of Personal Data generated in
        connection with the Data Subject&rsquo;s use of any third party services and applications as specified in the privacy
        policy of such third party service or application. We do not collect sensitive information (Personal Data of special
        categories).
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Disclosure of Personal Data For the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, Personal Data may be disclosed, when
        necessary, to authorities, other companies within the same group of companies as us, companies which the group
        cooperates with and to other third parties, such as third party service providers used in connection with our
        Services and services related thereto. Personal Data may be transferred outside the European Union and the European
        Economic Area (&ldquo;EU/EEA&rdquo;), including but not limited to, the United States of America, China, Australia, Singapore
        and Argentina as well as other locations and jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such transfers outside
        the EU/EEA are performed subject to appropriate safeguards such as standard data protection clauses adopted or
        otherwise approved by the EU Commission in accordance with the GDPR (&ldquo;Standard Data Protection Clauses&rdquo;). The
        applicable Standard Data Protection Clauses are made available for review to the Data Subject upon request.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Retention Period We retain Data Subject&rsquo;s Personal Data for three years from Data Subject&rsquo;s latest purchase or
        contact with us. Personal Data may be, wholly or in part, retained for longer or shorter term if required by
        applicable law or if there is other justified reason to retain or delete them. In such a case, Data Subject&rsquo;s
        Personal Data shall be erased with no further delay after there is no longer any need for such a retention. We
        evaluate the necessity and accuracy of the Personal Data on a regular basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Data Subjects&rsquo; Rights Data Subject has a right to request from us: &bull; access to and rectification or erasure of
        Data Subject&rsquo;s Personal Data; &bull; for restriction of processing concerning the Data Subject or to object to
        processing; and &bull; to receive, under certain preconditions, Data Subject&rsquo;s Personal Data in a structured, commonly
        used and machine-readable format and to transmit those data to another controller. Data Subject may exercise the
        aforementioned rights by sending a written request to us. Where the processing is based on consent, Data Subject has
        a right to withdraw such consent at any time. Please Policy that this will not affect the lawfulness of processing
        based on consent before its withdrawal. In case the Data Subject considers that its rights under the data protection
        laws are infringed, the Data Subject may lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority of the Data Subject&rsquo;s
        residence in the EU (e.g. in Finland the Finnish Data Protection Ombudsman).
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Security Safeguards Securing the integrity and confidentiality of Personal Data. We have taken adequate technical
        and organisational measures in order to keep Personal Data safe and to secure it against unauthorized access, loss,
        misuse or alteration by third parties, such as encryption, access controls, firefalls. Nevertheless, considering the
        cyber threats in modern day online environment, we cannot 100% guarantee that our security measures will prevent
        illegally and maliciously operating third parties from obtaining access to Personal Data and the absolute security
        of that information during its transmission or its storage on our systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Other We may make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time by giving Policy on the website and/or by other
        applicable means. It is highly recommended that Data Subjects check this Privacy Policy and the website every now
        and then, referring to the date of the last modification listed at the top of this page. If a Data Subject objects
        to any of the changes to this Privacy Policy, the Data Subject should cease using the Services, where applicable,
        and can request that we remove the Personal Data, unless applicable laws require storage of the Personal Data.
        Unless stated otherwise, the then-current Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Data we have about Data
        Subjects.
      </p>
